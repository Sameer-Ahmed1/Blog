How often do you buy things, hoard them and then never use them? Okay maybe for a day or even a week and after that? They end up being in the same graveyard of unneccessary things we were collecting over the years. We are constantly sorrunded by so much that we have little focus on a particular thing. We forgot what to prioritise.Our homes are crowded with unused items—things that aren’t adding value to our lives. Our calendars and todo lists are filled with tasks that decieves us in thinking we are productive and doing meaningful work. Social media and motivation gurus had us believe “the more the merrier”. According them if you are not working 12 hours a day and chasing materialism, then you are not doing enough, even if costs you your mental health.

You may have come across this word “Minimalism” somewhere on youtube or an article on internet. In the last decade or so it has become immensely popular and a lot of people catching up to the trend. Influencers can be seen pr omoting their cozy bedrooms or going “car-free” or some even turning vegan. Alright, Let’s cut to the chase and define what is Minimalism? According to [theminimalists.com](http://theminimalists.com), _Minimalism is a tool to rid yourself of life’s excess in favor of focusing on what’s important—so you can find happiness, fulfillment, and freedom._ _It is about doing more with less._

Minimalism about removing the clutter from our life. It sets us free and channel our focus on only what’s important and what matters. Selling or giving away the books you never read or shortening your todo lists or unsubscribing from learning courses you rarely follow can all count as switching to minimalism. Our brains fail to function properly when there’s too much to look after. As tempting as it may seem we don’t have to have to buy every new product in the market just because everyone else is buying it.

But wait! Does that mean I can’t have nice things? No, not at all. Rather it is the opposite, it is about having only the nice things and things you care about and throwing away the unneccesary stuff that’s coming in your way to happiness(not literally!). Some people fall into the misconception that minimalism means we should completely ditch the materialistic lifestyle and should not own anything. They think living in a cave away from city life and eating plants is what minimalism is, it may sound cool for a new Netflix series but minimalism is way more practical than that.

Our problem is: we assign too much meaning to things, often forsaking our health, our relationships, our passions, our personal growth, and our desire to contribute beyond ourselves.But in reality, does it really make us happy and content?

Minimalists search for happiness not through things, but through life itself. Incase you haven’t realised till now it isn’t just about physical possessions. Take a look at your phone and you’ll see there are lot of apps taking up your memory which you rarely use. You may have purchased some online courses to learn a new skill and are now rarely keeping up with it. Your freinds have this new watch or new shoes and you want to have it too even though deep down you know it is not much of a use to you.

Is minimalism same for everyone? Probably not , what works for a 45 year old may not work for a 20 year old. its up to you to determine what is necessary and what is superfluous in your life. For some people having pricey comfy sofa can be a neccessity so they can enjoy their time with their loved ones but others can be content with a normal couch. It’s all boils down to one principle _If they are not getting in the way to do what matters then don’t need to get rid of them._

Can you achieve perfect minimalism? Ah again no, why? Because we don’t live in a perfect world, there will be times when you fall into the temptation and spend your time and money on unneccessary stuff, it is normal. Striving everyday to keep it simple and dedicating your energy to few things that are the most important and are worthy of your attention is what minimalism is all about.
