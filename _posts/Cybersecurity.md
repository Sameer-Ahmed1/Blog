It was January 2016 , an employee at the Bangladesh bank was checking his email at work. He clicks an email which appeared to be harmless at first but what resulted afterwards was one of the biggest heist in the history of the nation’s banking system. The infected email immediately began installing a malicious program in the bank’s computer systems. This program allowed the hackers to rob the bank with a hefty amount of around 1 billion us dollars. This was and still is an exemplary case of cyberattack . To prevent such crimes an entirely different branch in the field of software already exists, namely, cybersecurity. To put it simply, cybersecurity is the practice of protecting critical systems and sensitive information from digital attacks.

Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, once stated, "we live in a civilization of software". With the advancements in the technology, our reliance on computers is increasing with a rapid pace. Such dependance on computers and software also comes with its own share of risks and flaws. From the worlds first virus in 1971, the Creeper, till this day computers and other such devices are constantly being victim to viruses, malwares and other such attacks. Some common cyberattacks include the Ddos attack (Distributed denial of service) which makes it impossible for a website to function properly, the MTM attack (man in the middle ) which enables an attacker to interfere with the data sent between computers or networks and the Phishing attack, in which an attacker sends malicious email to grab sensitive information from the target.

To counterbalance, the discipline of cybersecurity is equally diverse as these attacks . Cybersecurity can be categorised as : Network security, Application Security, Information Security and Operational Security. To breakdown the technical jargon: informational security is protecting the users data from any threat while network security, as name suggests, is securing a computers network. Before being released n the market , Software is often thoroughly tested to protect from threats, this comes under application security. Frequent updates to the software can also be made available under Application security. informational security, involves decisions for handling and protecting users data such as where to store this data etc.

There are several large firms dedicated for cybersecurity, McAfee, Cisco, Avast and IBM are few worth mentioning. Thanks to these firms and vulnerability of the modern software, cybersecurity still remains a promising career. It’s worth mentioning that term “Ethical Hacking ” saw a huge boom in last 2-3 years. However it is just a portion of the vast field of cybersecurity which provides security analyst , security engineer ,penetration tester and cryptographer etc as career options. This does not mean that the term cybersecurity is limited to professional world. It must be practiced at home too. Reporting suspicious emails, scanning the application before installing, avoiding suspicious links etc are all regarded as practicing internet safety.Governments around the world also play significant roles in prevention of cybercrimes and cyberattacks. The National Cyber Coordination Center (NCCC) of India is an example of one such organization.

The necessity of cybersecurity is an ever growing one. The fact that even the tech giants companies such as google and facebook are not immune to cyberattacks such as data breaches only speaks in favor of the significant role of cybersecurity in 21st century.
